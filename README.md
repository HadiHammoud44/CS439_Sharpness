# Adaptive Sharpness and Generalization
Code for CS439 Optimization for Machine Learning (2023), developed by Hadi Hammoud, LÃ©o Nicollier, and Orfeas Liossatos. 
The goal of the project is to study the relationship between adaptive worst-case sharpness and test loss on LeNet-5, FCNN, and GAT.

## Top-Level Directory Structure
Three python notebooks are available. Each notebook trains 50 models from scratch on a dataset and runs Projected Gradient Ascent to estimate sharpness, producing plots comparing sharpness to test loss. The file structure is the following.
+ **/Datasets** contains the Abalone dataset for FCNN
+ **/Plots** contains the results of our experiments
+ **GAT_model.ipynb** is a notebook that runs the experiment on a graph attentional network
+ **LeNet5_model.ipynb** is a notebook that runs the experiment on LeNet-5
+ **FCNN_model.ipynb** is a notebook that runs the experiment on a fully connected neural network
