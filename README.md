# Adaptive Sharpness and Generalization
This is our project code for CS439 Optimization for Machine Learning (2023). The project was developed by Hadi Hammoud, LÃ©o Nicollier, and Orfeas Liossatos. The goal of the project is to empirically test the relationship between adaptive worst-case sharpness and test loss on three models: LeNet-5, a fully connected neural network, and graph attentional network.

Three notebooks contain the entire project code and produce plots comparing sharpness to test loss.
